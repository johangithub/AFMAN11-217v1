# Chapter 3 NAVIGATION INSTRUMENTS

3.1. Application. The navigation instruments explained in this chapter are still common in
many USAF aircraft or are incorporated in digital (glass) cockpit displays. These instruments
are the radio magnetic indicator (RMI), course indicator (CI), range indicator, bearing-distanceheading indicator (BDHI), flight director, and Flight Management System (FMS).

3.2. Basic Systems.

3.2.1. Radio Magnetic Indicator (RMI) (Figure 3.1). The RMI displays aircraft heading with
navigational bearing data. It normally consists of a rotating compass card and two bearing
pointers. The compass card is actuated by the aircraft compass system. The aircraft
magnetic heading is displayed on the compass card beneath the top index. The bearing
pointers display automatic direction finding (ADF), VHF Omni directional Range (VOR), or
Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN) magnetic bearing to the selected navigation station.
Placards on the instrument or near a selector switch are normally used to identify the bearing
pointer display. VOR or TACAN radials are displayed under the tail of their respective
bearing pointers. Bearing pointers do not function in relation to instrument landing system (ILS) signals.

##### Figure 3.1. Navigation Instruments.

3.2.1.1. Compass System Malfunction. If there is a malfunction in the compass system
or compass card, the ADF bearing pointer continues to point to the station, and displays
relative bearing only but the VOR or TACAN pointers may still indicate magnetic
bearing. Until verified by radar or other navigational equipment, consider this bearing
information unreliable. VOR and TACAN bearing pointers do not "point" to an area of
maximum signal strength, as does an ADF. VOR and TACAN navigation receivers
electronically measure the magnetic course which is then displayed by the pointers on the
RMI.

3.2.2. Course Indicator (CI) (Figure 3.1). The course indicator operates independently of the
RMI. It displays aircraft heading and position relative to a selected VOR/TACAN course,
and lateral and vertical position relative to an ILS localizer and glide slope. Most USAF
aircraft now have the functions of the CI incorporated in the Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI).

3.2.2.1. VOR or TACAN Display.

3.2.2.1.1. Course indicator. When the course indicator is used to display VOR or
TACAN information, aircraft heading and position are indicated relative to a selected
course. The desired course is set in the course selector window with the course set
knob.

3.2.2.1.2. The Heading Pointer. The heading pointer interfaces with the course set
knob and the compass system and displays aircraft heading relative to the selected
course. When the aircraft heading is the same as the course selected, the heading
pointer indicates 0° heading deviation at the top of the course indicator. The heading
deviation scales, at the top and bottom of the course indicator are scaled in 5°
increments up to 45°. The TO-FROM indicator indicates whether the course
selected, if properly intercepted and flown, will take the aircraft to or from the station.
When the aircraft passes a line from the station perpendicular to the selected course,
the TO-FROM indicator changes. Aircraft heading has no effect on the TO-FROM
indications.

3.2.2.1.3. Course Deviation Indicator. The course deviation indicator (CDI) displays
aircraft course deviation relative to the course selected. Most course indicators are
adjusted so the CDI is fully displaced when the aircraft is off course more than 10°.
Each dot on the course deviation scale represents 5°.

3.2.2.1.4. Course Warning Flag. Appearance of the course warning flag indicates
that the course indicator is not receiving a signal strong enough for reliable navigation
information.
See Chapter 7 for discussion on Navigation Aid (NAVAID)
identification.

3.2.2.1.4.1. NOTE: Although the course indicator may be receiving a signal
strong enough to keep the course warning flag out of view, consider the signal
reliable only if the warning flag is not displayed, the station identification is being
received and the bearing pointer is pointing to the station.

3.2.2.2. ILS Display.

3.2.2.2.1. Localizer Course. When used to display ILS signals, the course indicator
provides precise ILS localizer course information for a specified approach. The
following information pertains to course indicator functions and displays when used
with an ILS:

3.2.2.2.1.1. The TO-FROM indicator is unusable.

3.2.2.2.1.2. Full-scale deflection. Full-scale deflection on the course deviation
scale differs with the width of the localizer course (up to 6°). Example: If the
localizer course is 5° wide, then full-scale deflection is 2½° and each dot is 1¼°;
if the localizer course is 3° wide, then full-scale deflection is 1½° and each dot is ¾°.

3.2.2.2.1.3. When flying the localizer, the course set knob and course selected
have no effect on the CDI display. The CDI displays only if the aircraft is on
course or in a 90- or 150-Hz zone of signals originating from the ILS localizer
transmitter. The CDI always deflects to the left of the instrument case in the 150Hz zone and to the right in the 90-Hz zone. It centers when the signal strength of
both zones is equal. Although the course selected has no effect on the CDI, to
enhance situational awareness, the pilot should always set the published inbound
FRONT COURSE of the ILS in the course selector window.

3.2.2.2.2. The glide slope indicator (GSI) displays glide slope position relative to the
aircraft. Full-scale deflection of the GSI is dependent upon the width of the glide
slope. Example: If the glide slope width is 1.4°, full-scale deflection would be .7°,
and each dot would be .35°.

3.2.2.2.3. Warning Flags. Appearance of the course or glide slope warning flags
indicates that the course or glide slope signal strength is not sufficient. Absence of
the identifier indicates the signal is unreliable. See Chapter 7 for discussion on
NAVAID identification.

3.2.2.2.3.1. CAUTION: It is possible under certain conditions for the CDI or
GSI to stick in any position with no warning flags while reliable station
identification is being received. Pilots should use extreme caution and maintain
good situational awareness while flying an ILS or localizer approach in actual
weather conditions.

3.2.2.2.4. Marker Beacon. The marker beacon light and aural tone indicate
proximity to a 75-MHz marker beacon transmitter; for example, ILS outer marker (OM), middle marker (MM), inner marker (IM), etc. As the aircraft flies through the
marker beacon signal pattern, the light flashes and the aural tone sounds in Morse
code indicating the type of beacon. The marker beacon light functions independently
of ILS/VOR/TACAN signals.

3.2.3. Range Indicator (Figure 3.1). Range indicators display slant range distance in nautical
miles to a DME transponder. For practical purposes, you may consider this a horizontal
distance except when the aircraft is very close to the station. DME range information is
subject to line-of-sight restrictions and altitude directly affects the reception range. Most
USAF aircraft now incorporate DME into the HSI or a separate digital readout display.

##### Figure 3.2. Bearing Distance Heading Indicator (BDHI).

3.2.4. Bearing-Distance-Heading Indicator (BDHI) (Figure 3.2).

3.2.4.1. BDHI Display. The BDHI displays aircraft heading with navigational bearing
data and range information. Except for the range indicator, the BDHI is similar in
appearance and function to the RMI previously described.

3.2.4.2. BDHI Components. The BDHI consists of a rotating compass card, two bearing
pointers, a range indicator, and a range warning flag. Some BDHIs also have a heading
marker, a heading set knob, and a power warning flag.

3.2.4.3. Compass Card Actuation. The compass card is actuated by the aircraft compass
system which normally includes pilot-operated controls that permit the BDHI compass
card to operate in a slaved or non-slaved direct gyro (DG) mode. In the slaved mode, the
aircraft magnetic heading is displayed beneath the top index or lubber line. In the nonslaved DG mode, the compass card serves as a heading reference after being corrected to
a known heading. The card is manually corrected for the DG mode by a switch on the
compass control panel.

3.2.4.4. Heading Marker. The heading marker, if incorporated, may be positioned on the
compass card by use of the heading set knob. Once positioned, the marker remains on a
fixed heading. To maintain the selected heading, turn to place the heading marker
beneath the upper lubber line.

3.2.4.5. Bearing Pointers. The bearing pointers indicate the magnetic bearing to the
selected ADF, VOR, or TACAN station. Placards on the instrument or near a selector
switch are used in most aircraft to identify the bearing pointer display.

3.2.4.5.1. NOTE: When tuned to an ILS frequency, bearing pointers will normally
slave to a position 45 or 90 degrees from the upper lubber line. Refer to flight manual
for details.

3.2.4.6. Malfunctions. If there is a malfunction in the compass system or compass card,
an ADF bearing pointer continues to point to the station and displays relative bearing
only. TACAN/VOR pointers may continue to indicate proper magnetic bearings. Until
verified by radar or other navigation equipment, consider this bearing information
unreliable.

3.3. Flight Director. The flight director provides the pilot with displays of pitch and bank
attitudes and the navigation situation of the aircraft. The flight director, when combined with
round dial performance instruments, is termed the flight director system (FDS). When the flight
director is combined with vertical scale instruments it is termed the integrated flight instrument
system (IFIS). The three components of the flight director of major interest are the attitude
director indicator (ADI), the horizontal situation indicator (HSI), and the flight director
computer.

##### Figure 3.3. Typical Flight Director.

3.3.1. Attitude Director Indicator (ADI) (Figures 3.3 and 3.4).

3.3.1.1. Parts of Attitude Director Indicator. The ADI usually consists of an attitude
indicator, rate of turn and slip indications, glide slope indicator, command bars, attitude
warning flag, glide slope warning flag, and course warning flag. Additional information
displayed on some ADIs includes radar altitude information, approach speed deviation,
and a runway symbol that displays lateral and vertical displacement from the runway.

3.3.1.1.1. Glide Slope Pointer. The glide slope pointer (GSP) displays glide slope
position in relation to the aircraft. If the GSP is above or below center the glide slope
is above or below the aircraft respectively. GSP scale deflection differs with the
width of the glide slope (1° to 1.8°). Example: If the glide slope width was 1°, fullscale deflection would be ½° and each dot would be ¼° (Figure 3.3).

##### Figure 3.4. ADI and HSI.

3.3.1.1.2. Command Bars. The command bars display steering information to
intercept or maintain a desired flight path. To utilize the steering function, simply
"fly" the ADI‘s aircraft symbol by adjusting the aircraft attitude until it is snugly
aligned beneath the command bars. The bars will command the proper pitch and
bank to turn, intercept, and maintain a course and altitude.

3.3.1.1.2.1. NOTE: Warning flags are incorporated in the ADI to indicate failure
or unreliability of presentations. Check the aircraft flight manual for specific
warning flags applicable to your aircraft. In some ADIs, if power fails to the
pitch and bank steering bars, no warning flags will appear, and the pitch and bank
steering bars will center. Monitor the identifier to ensure that the signal is
reliable. In most aircraft a warning flag appears when the signal strength is
insufficient.

3.3.2. Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI) (Figures 3.3 and 3.4). The horizontal situation
indicator combines the heading indicator, RMI, CI, and range indicator into one display. (See explanations of these functions in previous sections of this chapter.) Additional features
available on electronic HSIs include arc formats to display a segment of the standard display
as well as map formats used to pictorially display aircraft position in relation to NAVAIDS
or waypoints. (Figure 3.5.)

##### Figure 3.5. Electronic HIS.

3.3.2.1. Course Selector Knob. The course selector knob on most HSI‘s may be used to
select any course by rotating the head of the course arrow to the desired course on the
compass card. Check the course selector window for the proper setting.

3.3.2.2. Heading Set Knob. The heading set knob moves the heading marker to a desired
heading. With the proper mode selected on the flight director control panel, the heading
marker can be slaved to the flight director computer. Thus, when a heading is set, the
command bars will command the bank attitude required to turn to and maintain the
selected heading.

3.3.3. Flight Director Computer.
The flight director computer receives navigation
information from the navigation systems and attitude information from the attitude gyro.
Depending on the modes available and selected, the computer supplies pitch or bank
commands to the command bars of the ADI. The command bars can be used for many
functions such as intercepting VOR, TACAN, and Doppler courses or performing data link
intercepts. Pitch command information can vary from terrain avoidance to flying a glidepath
or changing altitudes. In all cases, the command bars display command information and do
not reflect actual aircraft position. Refer to the appropriate flight manual for the specific
capabilities of the system installed in your aircraft.

3.3.4. Flight Director Modes.

3.3.4.1. Heading Mode. The flight director will sync the command bars to the heading
marker to keep the aircraft on the selected heading.

3.3.4.2. ILS Intercept Mode. The flight director will cause the command bars to steer the
aircraft onto and maintain the ILS course selected in the navigation radios.

3.3.4.2.1. Wind drift. Some computers supply wind drift compensation.

3.3.4.2.2. Bank angle. Maximum bank angle commanded is usually 25° to 35°,
depending on the system.

3.3.4.2.3. Intercept angle. Maximum intercept angle commanded is normally about45°.

3.3.4.2.4. ILS Final Approach Mode. Adds pitch inputs to the command bars to fly
to and maintain the glideslope. In this mode, commanded bank angle is normally
limited to a maximum of 15° and maximum pitch attitude commanded is 10° to 17°,
depending on the system.

3.4. Flight Management System (FMS). Many newer aircraft are equipped with an FMS
consisting of a Flight Management Computer (FMC), one or more Control Display Units (CDU),
an internal navigation database, and various displays and annunciators (Figure 3.6). The FMS
utilizes aircraft sensors and navigation database information to compute and display aircraft
position, performance data, and navigation information during all phases of flight. The FMS
may interface and provide guidance commands to autopilot, flight director, and auto-throttle
systems.

##### Figure 3.6. Typical Flight Management System.

3.4.1. Flight Management Computer. The FMC gathers aircraft position information from
multiple onboard sensors and navigation aids including VOR, DME, TACAN, Inertial
Reference Systems (IRS), Inertial Navigation Systems (INS), Global Positioning System (GPS), and Air Data Computers.
Using this aircraft position information, navigation
functions such as course and distance to a waypoint, desired track, groundspeed, and
estimated time of arrival are computed and displayed on the CDU and other aircraft
instruments. Additionally, fuel flow information may be used by the FMC to calculate and
update fuel consumption, specific range, and fuel overhead destination information.

3.4.2. Control Display Unit. The CDU allows the aircrew to interface with the FMC. The
CDU normally consists of a display screen, data entry pad, and function and line select keys.
The CDU allows menu-driven selection of various FMS modes, such as initialization, fuel
planning, performance, and navigation. The pilot may input flight plan route and various
other flight parameters into the CDU to enhance situational awareness and the navigational
capabilities of the aircraft.

3.4.3. Navigation Database. An FMS normally contains an internal navigation database with
either regional or worldwide coverage. The database typically includes information on
navigation aids, airports, runways, waypoints, routes, airways, intersections, departures and
arrivals, and instrument approaches. Aircrews may also store defined routes and waypoints
in the database. Navigation databases require periodic updates, normally on a 28-day cycle,
to ensure data is current.

3.5. Single Medium Displays. A single medium display is a Head-Up Display (HUD), HeadDown Display (HDD), or Helmet-Mounted Display (HMD) (Figure 3.7). These systems can
display control, performance, and navigation data in the pilot‘s outside field of view, enabling
him to clear and monitor instruments simultaneously. Information received from HUD
equipment that is not certified for sole-reference instrument flight by HQ USAF/A3O must be
verified with other cockpit indications.

##### Figure 3.7. Helmet Mounted Display.

3.5.1. Some single medium displays have the ability to project a Flight Path Marker (FPM)
to display vector flight paths. This projection gives a predictive line that shows where the
aircraft is going based on current flight parameters. On HUDs the FPM can be used to plan
terrain clearance maneuvers on low levels, determine where the aircraft will touch down
when landing, etc. Drawbacks to the FPM include the tendency of the display to float
around, especially in crosswinds, the bobbing motion of the FPM as it lags behind the
movement of the nose of the aircraft, and the degraded usefulness of the FPM when it
exceeds the limits of the instrument's field-of-view at high angles of attack and in large drift
or yaw situations.

3.5.2. More advanced displays use a Climb/Dive Marker (CDM) as the command flight
symbol for vector flying. The CDM will utilize the concept of the above FPM and flight path
scale, but both will be caged to the center of the display to prevent the symbology from
drifting off the usable area of the instrument.
